# catfish

Final project for Vue.js course. It is a memory game where you have to remember the pairs of cards, flip them over and guess the right cards. The image to guess can also be a decoy which is not existing on the main board.

There are two modes of the game: fetch random photos or fetch photos matching your search criteria.

You can change the settings of the game: time limit to memorize the cards and number of cards to memorize.

Also you can change the size of the cards while in game.
